# Holy Unblocker LTS (v6.x.x)

Holy Unblocker LTS, an experimental web proxy service, can bypass web filters or 'blockers' regardless of whether the method of censorship is client-side or network-based. This includes the potential ability to bypass content blockers overseas, Chrome extensions, localized client firewalls, and network-related filters.

This project serves mostly as a proof of concept for the ideal clientless solution to bypassing censorship. Being a secure web proxy service, it supports numerous sites while being updated frequently and concentrating on detail with design, mechanics, and features.

Works with a large number of sites, including YouTube, Discord, and more!
Also has a good amount of locally hosted games featured on the site.

#### Supports

- Youtube.com
- Discord.com
- Google.com
- Reddit.com
- Bing.com
- And more sites!

## You can support Holy Unblocker by starring the repository!

#### Features:

- Tab customization using the Options menu for improved stealth
- Considerable variety with the open selection of proxy types
- Game library with moderately decent titles
- Has frequent support articles for issues relating to the various proxy instances

### It is highly recommended you switch branches via your IDE to a stable released branch. Often the master branch contains unstable or WIP changes.

#### Example v6.x instead of master

The default place for the proxy when its started is `http://localhost:8080`, but you can change it if needed in `/src/config.json`.

This website is hosted locally with Ultraviolet and Rammerhead built-in.

This option will be a config option on the server side before rendering with Express for a performance focus. Meta elements will have an additonal attribute indicating if they should be moved. This is to ensure a SEO source can be served by config or a source focused on pure censorship evasion.
- [ ] Optimize the stylesheets and the HTML layout. Add more proper commenting and redivide the code so that it's less hard on the eyes.

- Switched to Fastify for serving content from the backend; a separate Express backend file is kept in case it's still needed
- Rammerhead is now locally built into the HU LTS repository
- Simplified the HU LTS setup process and added more default npm commands

## Vague Explanation for Beginners With External Proxies and Hosting

You will first want to host your proxies locally or externally. OUTDATED

#### List of some good hosting options:

- <a href="#">Oracle Cloud</a> (Free, Paid, Dedicated)
- <a href="https://repl.it">Repl.it</a> (Free)
- <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com">Azure</a> (Free and Paid)

Out of the list of hosting providers Dedipath and Azure rank first as a preference. You may also self-host.

After you have selected a decent VPS, use Cloudflare for the DNS records for both the site and the subdomains for the proxies.

This is an example of DNS records involving Heroku. Self-hosting will require `A records` preferably.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Holy-Unblocker/master/views/assets/img/dnssetup.png" width="500"></img>

- `@` and `www.example.ml` are being used for the local Ultraviolet proxy.
- `client.example.ml` is being used for Rammerhead.
- `a.example.ml` is being used for womginx.
- `cdn.example.ml` is being used for a private Ultraviolet host on the official sites.

As stated previously, Holy Unblocker is hosted locally with Ultraviolet.

#### Freenom/Domain Steps

For beginners, Freenom is a good provider for obtaining domains for free. However, Freenom only provides their TLDs (`.cf`, `.ml`, `.gq`, `.ga`, and `.tk`) for free, which can be easily blocked.

- Get some Freenom domains then add them to your Heroku instance (Personal > [App Name] > Settings > Domains)
  Add a domain for both `www.example.cf` and `example.cf` with .cf being interchangeable with other Freenom domain names.
- If you prefer to obtain premium domains (TLDs) then use <a href="https://porkbun.com">Porkbun</a>, which offers domains for amazing prices. Literally a `.net` domain normally costs around $10. On Porkbun for the first year it costs $3 so its definitely a deal.

#### Cloudflare Steps

- Use Cloudflare (make an account), add your site (Freenom Domain or other) and then add your various DNS targets to Cloudflare. Make sure you add Cloudflare's Nameservers which will be given later when you are adding your site.

Make sure they are CNAME although A records also work and try to follow this structure:

**Type | Name | Target**

`CNAME | @ | your-main-heroku-target-here.herokudns.com`  
`CNAME | www | your-main-heroku-target-here.herokudns.com`

**Below are if you want external proxies also with your site:**

`CNAME | a | your-womginx-instance-here.herokudns.com`

Make sure HTTPS is forced and have SSL set to Flexible for some services. Otherwise you can have SSL set to Full.

#### Workspace Configurations

Preferably if you have your own device use Visual Studio Code. Pretty much the best option you can get but obviously this is an opinion. Also make sure you have <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.JS</a> installed on your machine.

Not going to go too in depth with this part but first fork this repository. The clone it locally through a Terminal of some sort depending on what OS you are on. Make sure you navigate to the folder you want to set this up in.

```
git clone https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Holy-Unblocker.git

cd Holy-Unblocker

npm install
```

Now simply add the folder you cloned this repo in in VSC. Then run `npm install`. I recommend that if you are releasing this publically on GitHub that you add a `.gitignore` in your root directory with the following exclusions:

```
node_modules
```

Now you have your following workspace environment setup. To deploy the following workspace you just created you will need to look up depending on your hosting provider.

For an online IDE that you can use on your school computer and/or chromebook use GitPod. Basically the equivalent of Visual Studio Code but with in-browser support.

- Make an account: `https://gitpod.io/`
- Fork this repo and enter in this URL to setup your workspace: `https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/YourNameHere/Holy-Unblocker/`

Use the same steps above by running `npm install` in your repository and adding a `.gitignore` in your root directory specifying to exclude `node_modules`.

## Detailed FAQ

<details>
<summary>Quick FAQ</summary>

#### Where can I find the games for this repo? (404 errors, etc.)

Due to piracy concerns, size, etc. this has been moved over <a href="https://github.com/QuiteAFancyEmerald/HU-Archive">here</a>. EmuLibrary is not featured in the public version.

**Why is the site I am on not working correctly or having CAPTCHA errors?**

Captcha support is currently not available on all of the current proxies sadly. Therefore some sites may not work with any of the sites. Read below for issues with links on sites.

**I am getting 502 errors. What do I do?**

When this happens you may either switch sites to fix the error or wait a bit. Sometimes clearing your cache can help.

If you still have any questions feel free to ask them in the discord linked here.

### Why are official domains now numbered? Is this project maintained again?

Yes, this project is active again for LTS support! However, the approach is now much simpler to ensure functionality: traffic will be focused on a single domain. More than ever, this project serves as a proof of concept for the brave souls willing to innovate in the web proxy service space.

<details><summary>Former Closing Message (Original - 2022)</summary>

This isn’t the greatest announcement sorry. After lots of thought and severe hesitation I’m shutting down Holy Unblocker and leaving TN. It's just been something that I’ve been super conflicted with for months hence the lack of updates and the massive gaps that happened last year. I just didn’t want to throw away a project that I passionately enjoyed and spent time on while making amazing friends and meeting epic devs here. I could go on forever for who these people are but ima like leave it here. They know who they are :D

The main change of thought is that I’m finally just putting an end right now due to 1) the lack of motivation 2) the community is NOT the greatest at time and not the nicest at times (have to put that out here) 3) the future doesn’t look so good for HU/TN as a project.

Some things I’ll be keeping secret since there are more reasons to this choice unless otherwise for those who don’t find this enough information. Good friends here will know that I’ve been super stressed about this choice for months now. Also regardless a good motivator for this choice is the fact that I’ll be graduating soon.

It’s possible that I may continue/come back for this in the future or keep it on GitHub only. I leave this here because even now I am still doubting myself about this change. But for now I’d check out other proxy sites like Incognito (Duce DOES a ton of updates frequently and he is the creator/developer of Ultraviolet so give him some love) :yayy_hopi:

Check out his Patreon also! For current HU patrons you will not be billed next month and the HU Patreon will be archived so head over to Duce’s patron so he can purchase more domains for Incognito.

With love <3
